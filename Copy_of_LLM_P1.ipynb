The touch screen is receptive and easy to use, and I keep the light at a specific setting regardless of the time of day. (In any case, it's not hard to change the setting either, as you'll only be changing the light level at a certain time of day, not every now and then while reading).Also glad that I went for the international shipping option with Amazon. Extra expense, but delivery was on time, with tracking, and I didnt need to worry about customs, which I may have if I used a third party shipping service.   \n",

I am (was) a casual reader who owned a Nook Simple Touch from 2011. I've read the Harry Potter series, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series, 1984, Brave New World, and a few other key titles. Fair to say my Nook did not get as much use as many others may have gotten from theirs.Fast forward to today. I have had a full week with my new Kindle Paperwhite and I have to admit, I'm in love. Not just with the Kindle, but with reading all over again! Now let me relate this review, love, and reading all back to the Kindle. The investment of 139.00 is in the experience you will receive when you buy a Kindle. You are not simply paying for a screen there is an entire experience included in buying from Amazon.I have been reading The Hunger Games trilogy and shall be moving onto the Divergent series soon after. Here is the thing with the Nook that hindered me for the past 4 years: I was never inspired to pick it up, get it into my hands, and just dive in. There was never that feeling of oh man, reading on this thing is so awesome. However, with my Paperwhite, I now have that feeling! That desire is back and I simply adore my Kindle. If you are considering purchasing one, stop thinking about it simply go for it. After a full week, 3 downloaded books, and a ton of reading, I still have half of my battery left as well.Make yourself happy. Inspire the reader inside of you.   \n",

Great for reading. Had the original Fire since 2012. The Fire used to make my eyes hurt if I read too long. Haven't experienced that with the Paperwhite yet.   \n",
              "3  I bought one of the first Paperwhites and have been very pleased with it its been a constant companion and I suppose Ive read, on average, a book every three days for the past however many years on it. I wouldnt give it up youd have to pry it from my cold dead fingers.For sundry logistical reasons, Ive also made good use of Amazons Kindle app on my iPhone. No Paperwhite screen, naturally, and all the cool usability that delivers, but it works well and has its own attractions as a companion to the Kindle.Of course, there are aspects of the Paperwhite which I would like to critique. Ah you knew that was coming somewhere, didnt you.As a member of BookBub, I get a daily list of alerts and book deals in my chosen genres. I take on many of them, however, Ive found that, even with the best will in the world, I cant keep up. Some days it seems that for every book I read, Ive bought two. Theres just so much good stuff out there! The accumulative effect of this is that the number of books actually on my Paperwhite has been creeping ever upward for some time. Its now at about 400.With this in mind, Ive noticed that while page-turning has remained exactly the same, just about every other action on the Kindle has become positively glacial. Not just very slow, but so slow you think its malfunctioning. The general consensus appears to be that its to be expected once one has that many books downloaded onto a Kindle, it will begin to behave in a flakey manner. This drives me mad. Amazon states it can hold thousands of books. I believe them. But I figure I would need a second Paperwhite to read while Im waiting for actions to complete on the first one.Read more   \n",

The touch screen is receptive and easy to use, and I keep the light at a specific setting regardless of the time of day.

I've read the Harry Potter series, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series, 1984, Brave New World, and a few other key titles. Fair to say my Nook did not get as much use as many others may have gotten from theirs.Fast forward to today. I have had a full week with my new Kindle Paperwhite and I have to admit, I'm in love. Not just with the Kindle, but with reading all over again! Now let me relate this review, love, and reading all back to the Kindle. The investment of 139.00 is in the experience you will receive when you buy a Kindle. You are not simply paying for a screen there is an entire experience included in buying from Amazon.I have been reading The Hunger Games trilogy and shall be moving onto the Divergent series soon after. Here is the thing with the Nook that hindered me for the past 4 years: I was never inspired to pick it up, get it into my hands, and just dive in. There was never that feeling of oh man, reading on this thing is so awesome. However, with my Paperwhite, I now have that feeling! That desire is back and I simply adore my Kindle. If you are considering purchasing one, stop thinking about it simply go for it. After a full week, 3 downloaded books, and a ton of reading, I still have half of my battery left as well.Make yourself happy. Inspire the reader inside of you.</td>\n",

I wouldnt give it up youd have to pry it from my cold dead fingers.For sundry logistical reasons, Ive also made good use of Amazons Kindle app on my iPhone. No Paperwhite screen, naturally, and all the cool usability that delivers, but it works well and has its own attractions as a companion to the Kindle.Of course, there are aspects of the Paperwhite which I would like to critique. Ah you knew that was coming somewhere, didnt you.As a member of BookBub, I get a daily list of alerts and book deals in my chosen genres. I take on many of them, however, Ive found that, even with the best will in the world, I cant keep up. Some days it seems that for every book I read, Ive bought two. Theres just so much good stuff out there! The accumulative effect of this is that the number of books actually on my Paperwhite has been creeping ever upward for some time. Its now at about 400.With this in mind, Ive noticed that while page-turning has remained exactly the same, just about every other action on the Kindle has become positively glacial. Not just very slow, but so slow you think its malfunctioning. The general consensus appears to be that its to be expected once one has that many books downloaded onto a Kindle, it will begin to behave in a flakey manner. This drives me mad. Amazon states it can hold thousands of books. I believe them. But I figure I would need a second Paperwhite to read while Im waiting for actions to complete on the first one.Read more</td>\n",

I am (was) a casual reader who owned a Nook Simple Touch from 2011. I've read the Harry Potter series, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series, 1984, Brave New World, and a few other key titles. Fair to say my Nook did not get as much use as many others may have gotten from theirs.Fast forward to today. I have had a full week with my new Kindle Paperwhite and I have to admit, I'm in love. Not just with the Kindle, but with reading all over again! Now let me relate this review, love, and reading all back to the Kindle. The investment of 139.00 is in the experience you will receive when you buy a Kindle. You are not simply paying for a screen there is an entire experience included in buying from Amazon.I have been reading The Hunger Games trilogy and shall be moving onto the Divergent series soon after. Here is the thing with the Nook that hindered me for the past 4 years: I was never inspired to pick it up, get it into my hands, and just dive in. There was never that feeling of oh man, reading on this thing is so awesome. However, with my Paperwhite, I now have that feeling! That desire is back and I simply adore my Kindle. If you are considering purchasing one, stop thinking about it simply go for it. After a full week, 3 downloaded books, and a ton of reading, I still have half of my battery left as well.Make yourself happy. Inspire the reader inside of you.\",\n          \"I bought one of the first Paperwhites and have been very pleased with it its been a constant companion and I suppose Ive read, on average, a book every three days for the past however many years on it. I wouldnt give it up youd have to pry it from my cold dead fingers.For sundry logistical reasons, Ive also made good use of Amazons Kindle app on my iPhone. No Paperwhite screen, naturally, and all the cool usability that delivers, but it works well and has its own attractions as a companion to the Kindle.Of course, there are aspects of the Paperwhite which I would like to critique. Ah you knew that was coming somewhere, didnt you.As a member of BookBub, I get a daily list of alerts and book deals in my chosen genres. I take on many of them, however, Ive found that, even with the best will in the world, I cant keep up. Some days it seems that for every book I read, Ive bought two. Theres just so much good stuff out there! The accumulative effect of this is that the number of books actually on my Paperwhite has been creeping ever upward for some time. Its now at about 400.With this in mind, Ive noticed that while page-turning has remained exactly the same, just about every other action on the Kindle has become positively glacial. Not just very slow, but so slow you think its malfunctioning. The general consensus appears to be that its to be expected once one has that many books downloaded onto a Kindle, it will begin to behave in a flakey manner. This drives me mad. Amazon states it can hold thousands of books. I believe them. But I figure I would need a second Paperwhite to read while Im waiting for actions to complete on the first one.Read more\",\n          \"I initially had trouble deciding between the paperwhite and the voyage because reviews more or less said the same thing: the paperwhite is great, but if you have spending money, go for the voyage.Fortunately, I had friends who owned each, so I ended up buying the paperwhite on this basis: both models now have 300 ppi, so the 80 dollar jump turns out pricey the voyage's page press isn't always sensitive, and if you are fine with a specific setting, you don't need auto light adjustment).It's been a week and I am loving my paperwhite, no regrets!

I am (was) a casual reader who owned a Nook Simple Touch from 2011. I've read the Harry Potter series, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series, 1984, Brave New World, and a few other key titles. Fair to say my Nook did not get as much use as many others may have gotten from theirs.Fast forward to today. I have had a full week with my new Kindle Paperwhite and I have to admit, I'm in love. Not just with the Kindle, but with reading all over again! Now let me relate this review, love, and reading all back to the Kindle. The investment of 139.00 is in the experience you will receive when you buy a Kindle. You are not simply paying for a screen there is an entire experience included in buying from Amazon.I have been reading The Hunger Games trilogy and shall be moving onto the Divergent series soon after. Here is the thing with the Nook that hindered me for the past 4 years: I was never inspired to pick it up, get it into my hands, and just dive in. There was never that feeling of oh man, reading on this thing is so awesome. However, with my Paperwhite, I now have that feeling! That desire is back and I simply adore my Kindle. If you are considering purchasing one, stop thinking about it simply go for it. After a full week, 3 downloaded books, and a ton of reading, I still have half of my battery left as well.Make yourself happy. Inspire the reader inside of you.   \n",

Great for reading. Had the original Fire since 2012. The Fire used to make my eyes hurt if I read too long. Haven't experienced that with the Paperwhite yet.   \n",
              "3  I bought one of the first Paperwhites and have been very pleased with it its been a constant companion and I suppose Ive read, on average, a book every three days for the past however many years on it. I wouldnt give it up youd have to pry it from my cold dead fingers.For sundry logistical reasons, Ive also made good use of Amazons Kindle app on my iPhone. No Paperwhite screen, naturally, and all the cool usability that delivers, but it works well and has its own attractions as a companion to the Kindle.Of course, there are aspects of the Paperwhite which I would like to critique. Ah you knew that was coming somewhere, didnt you.As a member of BookBub, I get a daily list of alerts and book deals in my chosen genres. I take on many of them, however, Ive found that, even with the best will in the world, I cant keep up. Some days it seems that for every book I read, Ive bought two. Theres just so much good stuff out there! The accumulative effect of this is that the number of books actually on my Paperwhite has been creeping ever upward for some time. Its now at about 400.With this in mind, Ive noticed that while page-turning has remained exactly the same, just about every other action on the Kindle has become positively glacial. Not just very slow, but so slow you think its malfunctioning. The general consensus appears to be that its to be expected once one has that many books downloaded onto a Kindle, it will begin to behave in a flakey manner. This drives me mad. Amazon states it can hold thousands of books. I believe them. But I figure I would need a second Paperwhite to read while Im waiting for actions to complete on the first one.Read more   \n",

The touch screen is receptive and easy to use, and I keep the light at a specific setting regardless of the time of day. (In any case, it's not hard to change the setting either, as you'll only be changing the light level at a certain time of day, not every now and then while reading).Also glad that I went for the international shipping option with Amazon.

I've read the Harry Potter series, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series, 1984, Brave New World, and a few other key titles. Fair to say my Nook did not get as much use as many others may have gotten from theirs.Fast forward to today. I have had a full week with my new Kindle Paperwhite and I have to admit, I'm in love. Not just with the Kindle, but with reading all over again! Now let me relate this review, love, and reading all back to the Kindle. The investment of 139.00 is in the experience you will receive when you buy a Kindle. You are not simply paying for a screen there is an entire experience included in buying from Amazon.I have been reading The Hunger Games trilogy and shall be moving onto the Divergent series soon after. Here is the thing with the Nook that hindered me for the past 4 years: I was never inspired to pick it up, get it into my hands, and just dive in. There was never that feeling of oh man, reading on this thing is so awesome. However, with my Paperwhite, I now have that feeling! That desire is back and I simply adore my Kindle. If you are considering purchasing one, stop thinking about it simply go for it. After a full week, 3 downloaded books, and a ton of reading, I still have half of my battery left as well.Make yourself happy. Inspire the reader inside of you.</td>\n",

I wouldnt give it up youd have to pry it from my cold dead fingers.For sundry logistical reasons, Ive also made good use of Amazons Kindle app on my iPhone. No Paperwhite screen, naturally, and all the cool usability that delivers, but it works well and has its own attractions as a companion to the Kindle.Of course, there are aspects of the Paperwhite which I would like to critique. Ah you knew that was coming somewhere, didnt you.As a member of BookBub, I get a daily list of alerts and book deals in my chosen genres. I take on many of them, however, Ive found that, even with the best will in the world, I cant keep up. Some days it seems that for every book I read, Ive bought two. Theres just so much good stuff out there! The accumulative effect of this is that the number of books actually on my Paperwhite has been creeping ever upward for some time. Its now at about 400.With this in mind, Ive noticed that while page-turning has remained exactly the same, just about every other action on the Kindle has become positively glacial. Not just very slow, but so slow you think its malfunctioning. The general consensus appears to be that its to be expected once one has that many books downloaded onto a Kindle, it will begin to behave in a flakey manner. This drives me mad. Amazon states it can hold thousands of books. I believe them. But I figure I would need a second Paperwhite to read while Im waiting for actions to complete on the first one.Read more</td>\n",

I am (was) a casual reader who owned a Nook Simple Touch from 2011. I've read the Harry Potter series, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series, 1984, Brave New World, and a few other key titles. Fair to say my Nook did not get as much use as many others may have gotten from theirs.Fast forward to today. I have had a full week with my new Kindle Paperwhite and I have to admit, I'm in love. Not just with the Kindle, but with reading all over again! Now let me relate this review, love, and reading all back to the Kindle. The investment of 139.00 is in the experience you will receive when you buy a Kindle. You are not simply paying for a screen there is an entire experience included in buying from Amazon.I have been reading The Hunger Games trilogy and shall be moving onto the Divergent series soon after. Here is the thing with the Nook that hindered me for the past 4 years: I was never inspired to pick it up, get it into my hands, and just dive in. There was never that feeling of oh man, reading on this thing is so awesome. However, with my Paperwhite, I now have that feeling! That desire is back and I simply adore my Kindle. If you are considering purchasing one, stop thinking about it simply go for it. After a full week, 3 downloaded books, and a ton of reading, I still have half of my battery left as well.Make yourself happy. Inspire the reader inside of you.\",\n          \"I bought one of the first Paperwhites and have been very pleased with it its been a constant companion and I suppose Ive read, on average, a book every three days for the past however many years on it. I wouldnt give it up youd have to pry it from my cold dead fingers.For sundry logistical reasons, Ive also made good use of Amazons Kindle app on my iPhone. No Paperwhite screen, naturally, and all the cool usability that delivers, but it works well and has its own attractions as a companion to the Kindle.Of course, there are aspects of the Paperwhite which I would like to critique. Ah you knew that was coming somewhere, didnt you.As a member of BookBub, I get a daily list of alerts and book deals in my chosen genres. I take on many of them, however, Ive found that, even with the best will in the world, I cant keep up. Some days it seems that for every book I read, Ive bought two. Theres just so much good stuff out there! The accumulative effect of this is that the number of books actually on my Paperwhite has been creeping ever upward for some time. Its now at about 400.With this in mind, Ive noticed that while page-turning has remained exactly the same, just about every other action on the Kindle has become positively glacial. Not just very slow, but so slow you think its malfunctioning. The general consensus appears to be that its to be expected once one has that many books downloaded onto a Kindle, it will begin to behave in a flakey manner. This drives me mad. Amazon states it can hold thousands of books. I believe them. But I figure I would need a second Paperwhite to read while Im waiting for actions to complete on the first one.Read more\",\n          \"I initially had trouble deciding between the paperwhite and the voyage because reviews more or less said the same thing: the paperwhite is great, but if you have spending money, go for the voyage.Fortunately, I had friends who owned each, so I ended up buying the paperwhite on this basis: both models now have 300 ppi, so the 80 dollar jump turns out pricey the voyage's page press isn't always sensitive, and if you are fine with a specific setting, you don't need auto light adjustment).It's been a week and I am loving my paperwhite, no regrets!

I am (was) a casual reader who owned a Nook Simple Touch from 2011. I've read the Harry Potter series, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series, 1984, Brave New World, and a few other key titles. Fair to say my Nook did not get as much use as many others may have gotten from theirs.Fast forward to today. I have had a full week with my new Kindle Paperwhite and I have to admit, I'm in love. Not just with the Kindle, but with reading all over again! Now let me relate this review, love, and reading all back to the Kindle. The investment of 139.00 is in the experience you will receive when you buy a Kindle. You are not simply paying for a screen there is an entire experience included in buying from Amazon.I have been reading The Hunger Games trilogy and shall be moving onto the Divergent series soon after. Here is the thing with the Nook that hindered me for the past 4 years: I was never inspired to pick it up, get it into my hands, and just dive in. There was never that feeling of oh man, reading on this thing is so awesome. However, with my Paperwhite, I now have that feeling! That desire is back and I simply adore my Kindle. If you are considering purchasing one, stop thinking about it simply go for it. After a full week, 3 downloaded books, and a ton of reading, I still have half of my battery left as well.Make yourself happy. Inspire the reader inside of you.   \n",

Great for reading. Had the original Fire since 2012. The Fire used to make my eyes hurt if I read too long. Haven't experienced that with the Paperwhite yet.   \n",
              "3  I bought one of the first Paperwhites and have been very pleased with it its been a constant companion and I suppose Ive read, on average, a book every three days for the past however many years on it. I wouldnt give it up youd have to pry it from my cold dead fingers.For sundry logistical reasons, Ive also made good use of Amazons Kindle app on my iPhone. No Paperwhite screen, naturally, and all the cool usability that delivers, but it works well and has its own attractions as a companion to the Kindle.Of course, there are aspects of the Paperwhite which I would like to critique. Ah you knew that was coming somewhere, didnt you.As a member of BookBub, I get a daily list of alerts and book deals in my chosen genres. I take on many of them, however, Ive found that, even with the best will in the world, I cant keep up. Some days it seems that for every book I read, Ive bought two. Theres just so much good stuff out there! The accumulative effect of this is that the number of books actually on my Paperwhite has been creeping ever upward for some time. Its now at about 400.With this in mind, Ive noticed that while page-turning has remained exactly the same, just about every other action on the Kindle has become positively glacial. Not just very slow, but so slow you think its malfunctioning. The general consensus appears to be that its to be expected once one has that many books downloaded onto a Kindle, it will begin to behave in a flakey manner. This drives me mad. Amazon states it can hold thousands of books. I believe them. But I figure I would need a second Paperwhite to read while Im waiting for actions to complete on the first one.Read more   \n",

The touch screen is receptive and easy to use, and I keep the light at a specific setting regardless of the time of day. (In any case, it's not hard to change the setting either, as you'll only be changing the light level at a certain time of day, not every now and then while reading).Also glad that I went for the international shipping option with Amazon.

I've read the Harry Potter series, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series, 1984, Brave New World, and a few other key titles. Fair to say my Nook did not get as much use as many others may have gotten from theirs.Fast forward to today. I have had a full week with my new Kindle Paperwhite and I have to admit, I'm in love. Not just with the Kindle, but with reading all over again! Now let me relate this review, love, and reading all back to the Kindle. The investment of 139.00 is in the experience you will receive when you buy a Kindle. You are not simply paying for a screen there is an entire experience included in buying from Amazon.I have been reading The Hunger Games trilogy and shall be moving onto the Divergent series soon after. Here is the thing with the Nook that hindered me for the past 4 years: I was never inspired to pick it up, get it into my hands, and just dive in. There was never that feeling of oh man, reading on this thing is so awesome. However, with my Paperwhite, I now have that feeling! That desire is back and I simply adore my Kindle. If you are considering purchasing one, stop thinking about it simply go for it. After a full week, 3 downloaded books, and a ton of reading, I still have half of my battery left as well.Make yourself happy. Inspire the reader inside of you.</td>\n",

I wouldnt give it up youd have to pry it from my cold dead fingers.For sundry logistical reasons, Ive also made good use of Amazons Kindle app on my iPhone. No Paperwhite screen, naturally, and all the cool usability that delivers, but it works well and has its own attractions as a companion to the Kindle.Of course, there are aspects of the Paperwhite which I would like to critique. Ah you knew that was coming somewhere, didnt you.As a member of BookBub, I get a daily list of alerts and book deals in my chosen genres. I take on many of them, however, Ive found that, even with the best will in the world, I cant keep up. Some days it seems that for every book I read, Ive bought two. Theres just so much good stuff out there! The accumulative effect of this is that the number of books actually on my Paperwhite has been creeping ever upward for some time. Its now at about 400.With this in mind, Ive noticed that while page-turning has remained exactly the same, just about every other action on the Kindle has become positively glacial. Not just very slow, but so slow you think its malfunctioning. The general consensus appears to be that its to be expected once one has that many books downloaded onto a Kindle, it will begin to behave in a flakey manner. This drives me mad. Amazon states it can hold thousands of books. I believe them. But I figure I would need a second Paperwhite to read while Im waiting for actions to complete on the first one.Read more</td>\n",

I am (was) a casual reader who owned a Nook Simple Touch from 2011. I've read the Harry Potter series, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series, 1984, Brave New World, and a few other key titles. Fair to say my Nook did not get as much use as many others may have gotten from theirs.Fast forward to today. I have had a full week with my new Kindle Paperwhite and I have to admit, I'm in love. Not just with the Kindle, but with reading all over again! Now let me relate this review, love, and reading all back to the Kindle. The investment of 139.00 is in the experience you will receive when you buy a Kindle. You are not simply paying for a screen there is an entire experience included in buying from Amazon.I have been reading The Hunger Games trilogy and shall be moving onto the Divergent series soon after. Here is the thing with the Nook that hindered me for the past 4 years: I was never inspired to pick it up, get it into my hands, and just dive in. There was never that feeling of oh man, reading on this thing is so awesome. However, with my Paperwhite, I now have that feeling! That desire is back and I simply adore my Kindle. If you are considering purchasing one, stop thinking about it simply go for it. After a full week, 3 downloaded books, and a ton of reading, I still have half of my battery left as well.Make yourself happy. Inspire the reader inside of you.\",\n          \"I bought one of the first Paperwhites and have been very pleased with it its been a constant companion and I suppose Ive read, on average, a book every three days for the past however many years on it. I wouldnt give it up youd have to pry it from my cold dead fingers.For sundry logistical reasons, Ive also made good use of Amazons Kindle app on my iPhone. No Paperwhite screen, naturally, and all the cool usability that delivers, but it works well and has its own attractions as a companion to the Kindle.Of course, there are aspects of the Paperwhite which I would like to critique. Ah you knew that was coming somewhere, didnt you.As a member of BookBub, I get a daily list of alerts and book deals in my chosen genres. I take on many of them, however, Ive found that, even with the best will in the world, I cant keep up. Some days it seems that for every book I read, Ive bought two. Theres just so much good stuff out there! The accumulative effect of this is that the number of books actually on my Paperwhite has been creeping ever upward for some time. Its now at about 400.With this in mind, Ive noticed that while page-turning has remained exactly the same, just about every other action on the Kindle has become positively glacial. Not just very slow, but so slow you think its malfunctioning. The general consensus appears to be that its to be expected once one has that many books downloaded onto a Kindle, it will begin to behave in a flakey manner. This drives me mad. Amazon states it can hold thousands of books. I believe them. But I figure I would need a second Paperwhite to read while Im waiting for actions to complete on the first one.Read more\",\n          \"I initially had trouble deciding between the paperwhite and the voyage because reviews more or less said the same thing: the paperwhite is great, but if you have spending money, go for the voyage.Fortunately, I had friends who owned each, so I ended up buying the paperwhite on this basis: both models now have 300 ppi, so the 80 dollar jump turns out pricey the voyage's page press isn't always sensitive, and if you are fine with a specific setting, you don't need auto light adjustment).It's been a week and I am loving my paperwhite, no regrets! The touch screen is receptive and easy to use, and I keep the light at a specific setting regardless of the time of day. (In any case, it's not hard to change the setting either, as you'll only be changing the light level at a certain time of day, not every now and then while reading).Also glad that I went for the international shipping option with Amazon. Extra expense, but delivery was on time, with tracking, and I didnt need to worry about customs, which I may have if I used a third party shipping service.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cleaned_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"allow me to preface this with a little history i am was a casual reader who owned a nook simple touch from 2011 ive read the harry potter series girl with the dragon tattoo series 1984 brave new world and a few other key titles fair to say my nook did not get as much use as many others may have gotten from theirsfast forward to today i have had a full week with my new kindle paperwhite and i have to admit im in love not just with the kindle but with reading all over again now let me relate this review love and reading all back to the kindle the investment of 13900 is in the experience you will receive when you buy a kindle you are not simply paying for a screen there is an entire experience included in buying from amazoni have been reading the hunger games trilogy and shall be moving onto the divergent series soon after here is the thing with the nook that hindered me for the past 4 years i was never inspired to pick it up get it into my hands and just dive in there was never that feeling of oh man reading on this thing is so awesome however with my paperwhite i now have that feeling that desire is back and i simply adore my kindle if you are considering purchasing one stop thinking about it simply go for it after a full week 3 downloaded books and a ton of reading i still have half of my battery left as wellmake yourself happy inspire the reader inside of you\",\n          \"i bought one of the first paperwhites and have been very pleased with it its been a constant companion and i suppose ive read on average a book every three days for the past however many years on it i wouldnt give it up youd have to pry it from my cold dead fingersfor sundry logistical reasons ive also made good use of amazons kindle app on my iphone no paperwhite screen naturally and all the cool usability that delivers but it works well and has its own attractions as a companion to the kindleof course there are aspects of the paperwhite which i would like to critique ah you knew that was coming somewhere didnt youas a member of bookbub i get a daily list of alerts and book deals in my chosen genres i take on many of them however ive found that even with the best will in the world i cant keep up some days it seems that for every book i read ive bought two theres just so much good stuff out there the accumulative effect of this is that the number of books actually on my paperwhite has been creeping ever upward for some time its now at about 400with this in mind ive noticed that while pageturning has remained exactly the same just about every other action on the kindle has become positively glacial not just very slow but so slow you think its malfunctioning the general consensus appears to be that its to be expected once one has that many books downloaded onto a kindle it will begin to behave in a flakey manner this drives me mad amazon states it can hold thousands of books i believe them but i figure i would need a second paperwhite to read while im waiting for actions to complete on the first oneread more\",\n          \"i initially had trouble deciding between the paperwhite and the voyage because reviews more or less said the same thing the paperwhite is great but if you have spending money go for the voyagefortunately i had friends who owned each so i ended up buying the paperwhite on this basis both models now have 300 ppi so the 80 dollar jump turns out pricey the voyages page press isnt always sensitive and if you are fine with a specific setting you dont need auto light adjustmentits been a week and i am loving my paperwhite no regrets the touch screen is receptive and easy to use and i keep the light at a specific setting regardless of the time of day in any case its not hard to change the setting either as youll only be changing the light level at a certain time of day not every now and then while readingalso glad that i went for the international shipping option with amazon extra expense but delivery was on time with tracking and i didnt need to worry about customs which i may have if i used a third party shipping service\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
